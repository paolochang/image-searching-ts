## Image Searching TS

The goal of this challenge is to build an app that can search for images using an API. The steps are described below:

1. You will be using this API for this challenge: Pixabay API
2. There will be an input field at the top where a user can enter a search query
3. When they hit enter, the results should show in a nicely formatted grid below the input field. The input field should remain fixed at the top of the top
4. When the user scrolls, more results will be loaded for the search query. Try to implement this using scroll listeners instead of a package.

### Bonuses / Extensions

1. Can you handle showing results as the user types a search query? Make sure not to make too many API calls. What technique should you be using?
2. If you click on an image, it opens a large view of the image, and you can go back to your search results.
